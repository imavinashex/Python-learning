# Hi guys me Imavinashex making this program as a part of my learning python journey.///\\\
# This program prints multiplication table of 2 to 10 without user input.///\\\
# first I will show you the code without user input and then I will modify it to take user input in next 2nd_table_program.py.///\\\
# lets make it  step by step.///\\\
#  I writed all veriables.
num1 =  2 
num2 =  3
num3 =  4
num4 =  5
num5 =  6
num6 =  7
num7 =  8
num8 =  9
num9 =  10
# i am using range method to print multiplication table from 1 to 11.
# then in multiply with each number from 2 to 10 and i add essy to understand string like x , = and escape squence charector for batter view in terminal.

for a in range(1, 11):
    print(num1,"X",a,"=",num1*a,"\t",num2,"X",a,"=",num2*a,"\t",num3,"X",a,"=",num3*a,"\t",num4,"X",a,"=",num4*a,"\t",num5,"X",a,"=",num5*a,"\t",num6,"X",a,"=",num6*a,"\t",num7,"X",a,"=",num7*a,"\t",num8,"X",a,"=",num8*a,"\t",num9,"X",a,"=",num9*a,"\n")


print("Program Fineshed\n Thank you")
